      Oh, Potatoes and Molasses!<br>
      If you want some, oh just ask us<br>
      There're warm and soft like puppies and socks<br>
      Filled with cream and candy rocks
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, Potatoes and Molasses!<br>
      They're so much sweeter than algebra class<br>
      If your stomach is grumbling<br>
      And your mouth starts mumbling<br>
      There's only one thing to keep your brain from crumbling
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, Potatoes and Molasses!<br>
      If you can't see 'em put on your glasses<br>
      They're shiny and large like a fisherman's barge<br>
      You know you've had enough when you start seeing stars
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, Potatoes and Molasses!<br>
      It's the only thing left on your task list<br>
      They're short and stout they'll make everyone shout<br>
      For Potatoes and Molasses!<br>
      For Potatoes and...<br>
      That's enough

    <p>
      Among the fields of straw and stover<br>
      Clocked in 'til the work day is over<br>
      Time's a gentle stream, longer than it seems<br>
      Patient is the night
    </p>

    <p>
      How I long to see her face now<br>
      Her starry moonlit gaze now<br>
      I know she's never late, still anxiously I wait<br>
      Patient is the night
    </p>

    <p>
      I know she's never late, still anxiously I wait<br>
      Patient is the night

    <header>The Beast is Out There</header>

    <p>
      We all know the beast, pilgrim<br>
      He lurks out there in the unknown<br>
      Seeking those who are far from home<br>
      Hoping to never let you return
    </p>

    <p>
      Ooo, better beware<br>
      Ooo, the beast is out there<br>
      Ooo, better be wise<br>
      And don't believe his lies
    </p>

    <p>
      For once your will begins to spoil<br>
      He'll turn you to a tree of oil <br>
      And use you in his lantern for to burn
